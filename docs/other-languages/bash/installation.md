weight: 1

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the most widely used shell scripting language. Use Ray to help you debug your shell scripts and CLI tools, or to send Ray commands from your CLI from anywhere.

## node-ray-cli (JS)

<x-docs.github-repo repo="permafrost-dev/node-ray-cli" />

Install the package with `npm`:

```bash
npm install node-ray-cli
```

Install it globally to access it from any script/directory:

```bash
npm install -g node-ray-cli
```

Or run it without installing using `npx`:

```bash
npx node-ray-cli --help
```

## ray-cli (PHP)
