weight: 1
---

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) is a dynamic, open-source programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. Use Ray to help you debug your Ruby applications.

<x-docs.github-repo repo="spatie/ruby-ray" />

The Ruby gem is still in active development. We haven't released a stable version just yet, but you can already install and play around with the `0.x` version.

## Installing the gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-ray'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install ruby-ray
```

You should be able to use the `ray` function without any other steps.
